<p>Portland, a vibrant city nestled in the Pacific Northwest of the United States, is renowned for its unique weather patterns that add a touch of charm and unpredictability to daily life. As we delve into the intricacies of Portland&rsquo;s weather, we uncover a fascinating blend of rain, sun, and everything in between.</p>
<p>The rainy season in Portland is a defining characteristic of the city&rsquo;s climate. From fall through winter, the skies often open up, unleashing a steady stream of precipitation.

<p>In the United States, the term &ldquo;corona&rdquo; continues to cast a long and significant shadow over various aspects of daily life. Once a word that mainly referred to the outermost layer of the sun, it has now become a household name, synonymous with the global health crisis that has disrupted economies, social structures, and individual well-being.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic, which has the coronavirus at its core, has left an indelible mark. Take, for example, the healthcare system. Hospitals across the nation were overwhelmed in the early days of the outbreak. In some major cities like New York, intensive care units reached their breaking point, with a shortage of beds, ventilators, and medical staff. Data shows that during the peak of the first wave, the number of daily hospital admissions soared into the thousands, putting an unprecedented strain on the healthcare infrastructure.</p>
