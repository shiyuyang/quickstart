<p>In recent days, the United States has been under the shadow of an extreme heat warning that is causing concerns across the nation. This intense heatwave is not just an inconvenience but a potential threat to public health and various aspects of daily life.</p>

In some major cities, like Phoenix, Arizona, temperatures have reached up to 115°F (46°C) for several consecutive days.

As people crank up their air conditioners to stay cool, the demand for electricity has skyrocketed. Utility companies are struggling to keep up with the load, and there have been reports of power outages in some areas, leaving residents sweltering in the heat.</p>
