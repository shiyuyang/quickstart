<p>In the United States, the term &ldquo;corona&rdquo; continues to cast a long and significant shadow over various aspects of daily life. Once a word that mainly referred to the outermost layer of the sun, it has now become a household name, synonymous with the global health crisis that has disrupted economies, social structures, and individual well-being.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic, which has the coronavirus at its core, has left an indelible mark. Take, for example, the healthcare system. Hospitals across the nation were overwhelmed in the early days of the outbreak. In some major cities like New York, intensive care units reached their breaking point, with a shortage of beds, ventilators, and medical staff. Data shows that during the peak of the first wave, the number of daily hospital admissions soared into the thousands, putting an unprecedented strain on the healthcare infrastructure.</p>
