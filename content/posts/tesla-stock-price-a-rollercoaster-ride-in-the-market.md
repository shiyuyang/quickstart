In the ever - dynamic world of stock markets, Tesla's stock price has been a topic of intense interest and speculation. The electric vehicle giant has seen its share value fluctuate wildly in recent times.

Recently, Tesla's stock price has been on a rollercoaster journey. For example, in the past few months, it has experienced significant highs and lows. Some days, driven by positive news such as record - breaking vehicle deliveries, the stock price soars. When Tesla announced that it had delivered over 500,000 vehicles in a single quarter, the market responded enthusiastically. Investors saw this as a sign of the company's growing dominance in the global electric vehicle market, and the stock price jumped by a remarkable 15% in just a few trading days.

On the other hand, negative factors can also have a major impact on Tesla's stock price. Rumors about supply chain issues, for instance, can cause a dip.

In one instance, when such rumors spread, the stock price dropped by around 10% within a week.
